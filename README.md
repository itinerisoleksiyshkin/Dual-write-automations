## What can this tool do? 

Mainly this tool is intended as a utility to help save time during Dual-write setup and mainance tasks.
It doesen't look the prettiest but it does the job.

This is what it can do:

-	Apply the latest map version based on authors or any author
-	Apply integration keys
-	Refresh tables
-	Stop/Start the maps before and after
-	Run's on multi-threading, means multiple maps are applied at the same time.
-	Uploads maps to ADO Wiki 
-	Start / Stop / Pause maps 
-	Export configurations in the correct order 
-	Run initial sync 
-	Parallel deployment to multiple target environments only using command line or multiple instances of the UI
-	Compare two environments and show differences 

Generally the tool has a UI and a Console application execution. Ultimately the UI will call the console application with arguments. 
This makes it possible to also run any of what you are running in the UI also in an Azure pipeline. 
Be aware every function runs based on the configuration file, e.g. stopping maps will only stop the maps which are specified in the config. 

## How to get started?

1. Setup an environment with Dual-Write and the maps how you need/ want it
2. Export the configuration with the tool
